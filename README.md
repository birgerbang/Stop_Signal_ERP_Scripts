# Stop_Signal_ERP_Scripts
Matlabs scipts for analysing ERPs from EEG data of participants performing a stop signal task. Implemented using the EEGLAB analysis package.
In its current implementatation, the scipts should be run in order: script_v1.m, scipt_v2.m and script_v3.m before the model making make2level_pruned.m scipt at last.
The scipts will result in a study design comparing successful vs unsuccessful trials in the Stop Signal Task.
