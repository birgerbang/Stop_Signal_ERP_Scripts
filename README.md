# Stop_Signal_ERP_Scripts
Matlabs scipts for analysing ERPs from EEG data of participants performing a stop signal task. Implemented using the EEGLAB analysis package.
In its current implementatation, the scipts should be run in order: script_v1, scipt_v2 and script_v3 before with the model making scipt at last.
The scipts will result in a study design comparing successful vs unsuccessful trials in the Stop Signal Task.
